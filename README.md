  WorkoutKuy is an application that can help users to carry out exercise activities by providing directions in performing exercise movements and portions that need to be done by the user. WorkoutKuy provides several options within the app to choose the portion that suits the user, such as male or female gender, or the intensity level such as beginner, intermediate, and advanced. After determining the gender and level that has been given, the user will be directed to carry out training activities with the given stages. each stage has a time limit and portion in its implementation and is equipped with a timer so that it will be easier for users to calculate the time when doing exercise activities. If the user registers his email to the WorkoutKuy application, all training activities that have been carried out by the user will be recorded in the database so that it will not be lost even if the application is uninstalled.
